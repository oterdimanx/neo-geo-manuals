# React + Vite + Typescript

This project is a manual editor designed to produce ready to print manuals in pdf or equivalent formats. It's a fan project to complete my own set of Neo Geo SNK game manuals that I could want to print, in case I own a MVS to AES cartridge conversion/bootleg and want a nice manual for it.
It allows the user to request Image Generator AI API's such as stability, or openAI.
